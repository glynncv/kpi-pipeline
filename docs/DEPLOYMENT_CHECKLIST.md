---

## GitHub Configuration

### ✅ Repository Settings

---

## Release Preparation

### ✅ Version Tagging

- [ ] Release marked as latest

---

## Final Verification

### ✅ Clean Clone Test

Perform a clean clone to verify everything works:

```bash
# Clone to new location
cd ~/Desktop
git clone https://github.com/[YOUR-USERNAME]/kpi-pipeline.git test-deploy
cd test-deploy

# Run setup
./setup.sh  # or .\setup.bat on Windows

# Validate
python validate_project.py

# Run tests
python tests/test_pipeline.py

# Try with sample data
python tests/generate_sample_data.py
python main.py
```

**Results:**
- [ ] Setup script runs without errors

## Quick Deployment Commands

Once checklist is complete:

```bash
# Initialize and commit
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: KPI Pipeline v1.0.0"

# Connect to GitHub
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/[YOUR-USERNAME]/kpi-pipeline.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main

# Create release tag
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release version 1.0.0"
git push origin v1.0.0
```

**Then create release on GitHub website**

---

## Troubleshooting

If any checklist items fail:

1. **Code Issues**: Run `python validate_project.py` for diagnostics
2. **Test Failures**: Check `tests/test_pipeline.py` output
3. **Git Issues**: See `docs/GIT_WORKFLOW.md`
4. **GitHub Issues**: See `docs/GITHUB_SETUP.md`
5. **General Help**: See `docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md`
